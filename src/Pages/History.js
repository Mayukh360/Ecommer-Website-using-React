        The history of ecommerce websites dates back to the 1970s, when the first
      electronic transactions were conducted over the internet. However, it was
      not until the 1990s that the first ecommerce websites began to appear, as
      the internet became more widely available to the public. The first
      ecommerce transaction took place in 1994, when a man named Dan Kohn used a
      credit card to purchase a Sting CD over the internet. This paved the way
      for a new era of online shopping. In 1995, Amazon.com was launched,
      offering books for sale online. It quickly became a huge success, and soon
      expanded to offer a wide range of products. Other major players in the
      ecommerce industry, such as eBay and PayPal, also emerged during this
      time. As internet access became more widespread, and security protocols
      improved, ecommerce continued to grow at a rapid pace. By the early 2000s,
      many brick-and-mortar retailers had established online stores, and the
      number of ecommerce websites continued to increase.
